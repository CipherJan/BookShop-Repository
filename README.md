## BookShop

It is the main application that allows you to create and manage bookstores and stores books sold and sales history. Management options allow:
 - Order new books from the supplier automatically when their total number is reduced to 10% of the original value, or manually as needed.
 - To set a sale on books that are considered obsolete (Such books include books that were released more than a year ago). The discount depends on the genre of the book or it may not be available at all
 - Top up the balance sheet of the store for a specified amount
The store also allows you to view the current library of books and their purchases.
