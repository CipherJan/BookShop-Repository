The BookShop-Repository contains 4 ASP.NET Core applications that form a common system:
  1. BookShop; 
  2. BookProvider;
  3. BookExternalAPI;
  4. BookContractLibrary.

The purpose of this system is to provide the backend component of bookstores with extensive functionality.

## BookShop

It is the main application that allows you to create and manage bookstores and stores books sold and sales history. Management options allow:
 - Order new books from the supplier automatically or manually as needed;
 - To set a sale on books that are considered obsolete. The discount depends on the genre of the book or it may not be available at all;
 - Top up the balance sheet of the store for a specified amount.
The store also allows you to view the current library of books and their purchases.

#### Some explanations

- The library is updated automatically when the total number of books decreases to 10% of the original value equal to `MaxBookQuantity`;
- Books can only be of such genres as:
  -  Adventure,
  -  Drama,
  -  Encyclopedia,
  -  Fantastic,
  -  Novel.
- A book is considered obsolete if it was published more than a year ago;
- Discounts:
  - Adventure - 7%,
  - Encyclopedia - 10%,
  - Fantastic - 3%,
  - Other genres do not receive discounts;
- Acceptance of books is paid at the rate of 7% of their total cost.
